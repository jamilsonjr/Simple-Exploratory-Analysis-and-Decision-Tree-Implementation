(Attention!) To view the full dynamic output of the analysis go to [this nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamilsonjr/Simple-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Decision-Tree-Implementation/blob/main/Challenge_Jamilson_Junior.ipynb), thanks ðŸ™Œ! 

This notebook is a simple exploratory analysis of the listings datasets [provided by airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  The objective is to present a simple example of a walkthrough through all the steps taken to explore a dataset to futher be used for other tasks, like classification for example. At the end there is a simple application example of a decision tree to perform a classification task. Note that the objective is not to be very precise, but to present all the steps, so read it with a grain of salt ðŸ˜‰.

Thank you!
